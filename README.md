### Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: [click here](https://github.com/ramya-ramamur/Shopify-Interview-Challenge/blob/main/Shopify_Challenge_Question_1/2019%20Winter%20Data%20Science%20Intern%20Challenge%20Data%20Set.xlsx) to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
What metric would you report for this dataset?
What is its value?

#### **Solution:**

Data Exploration and Transformation
1. Data was pulled from an excel file and transferred to a pandas dataframe called "sneaker_shop" The dataset was examined for null values, dulicate data and outliers.

3. Unneeded columns "order_id", "user_id", "payment_method", "created_at" was dropped to create a new dataframe that had "shop_id", "order_amount", and "total_items"
4. A metric of Average Order Value was added as a column to the dataframe after  

**Observations:**
1. The original calculation for AOV (given in problem statement) seems to have just taken the mean (3145.13) of the order_amount without taking into account total_items ordered. The standard deviation and max value is also very high indicating there are some outliers. See summary statistics below.

2. Shop no 42 was the only shop with orders  more than 2000. Orders at the other shops are usually between 1-10 in the 30 day window. However since the  Average value (AOV) per order for shop 42 is 352 which lies in the "a relatively affordable item" spectrum.  There does not seem to be any anomaly.
3. There is one outlier - shop_id 78 with 46 orders with AOV of 25725 that is substantially higher than the other data points.
